	SEARCH ALGORITHMS
------------------------------------------------------------

- These are algorithms designed to solve search problems.
- They work to retrive information stored in a particular data structure.

- The appropriate search algorithm used depends on the data structure being searched


	LINEAR SEARCH ALGORITHM
--------------------------------------------------
![]()


- also(Sequential Search)

Involves searching the entire data structure until the target item is found. This particular data structure is best used in small unsorted data structures.



	BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
~[]()


A search algorithm that finds a target element in a SORTED data structure by dividing the data structure in half wit every iteration.


Compared to linear search, binary search is more efficient because it has fewer checks to perform



	PROJECT PURPOSE
--------------------------------------------------

- This project seeks to dive deeper into search algorithms by guiding the learner in implementing code in C language to demonstrate the various search algorithms as well as to dive into their different time complexities.

- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
